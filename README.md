# Hi, I’m Harsharaj Shetty B 👋

I like building things that sit at the intersection of creativity and logic. Some days it’s coding websites, other days it’s designing visuals, and often it’s experimenting with side projects that mix IoT, AI, and hardware tinkering. What started out as curiosity grew into a passion—and today, it shapes my work, projects, and ventures.
